## Renewable Power Converter and Data Collector

This project processes and converts input voltage from a renewable energy source and collects data from the converted output for analysis.

### How It Works
The power converter module reads the input voltage and applies a conversion process to generate the desired output voltage. The data collector module stores the output voltage for further use.

### How to Test
Connect the input voltage source and monitor the output. You can simulate the design using Verilog testbenches or use a TT08 demonstration board for real-world tests.

### External Hardware
- Renewable energy source (e.g., solar panel)
- LEDs or small batteries
