  author: "Vedant Misra"      # Your name
  discord: "vedmis001"      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description: "A TT08 implementation that can convert power output in voltage and record relevant power transmission data useful in infrastructure development"      # One line description of what your project does
  language: "Verilog" # Use "Verilog" only as the primary language
  clock_hz: 0       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your GitHub username:
  top_module: "tt_um_vedm_industries"  # Corrected to match Verilog naming convention
